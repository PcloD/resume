          I like to build things. Coding personal projects since the 7th grade
          has given me a great appreciation for perpetual self-learning through
          doing. I'm a huge advocate of open source, test driven development
          (untested code is broken code) and code review (unreviewed code is bad
          code). I have a fascination with puzzles and problem solving that both
          led me to success in national and international competition and
          fostered my passion in programming.  When I'm not pushing code, I can
          be found ranting on [my blog][], editing my [vim config][], or getting
          stomped in badminton.
