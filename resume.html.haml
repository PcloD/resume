          My name is Jamie Wong and I like to build things. Coding personal projects since the 7th grade has given me a
          great appreciation for perpetual self-learning through doing. I'm a huge advocate of open source, test driven
          development (untested code is broken code) and code review (unreviewed code is bad code). I have a fascination
          with puzzles and problem solving that both led me to success in national and international competition and
          fostered my passion in programming. When I'm not pushing the latest commits to my projects on [github][], I can be
          found answering questions on [Stack Overflow], writing up posts for [my blog], or playing badminton.
