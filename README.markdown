haml/markdown resume
====================

While you're free to use this as a template and fill in content, please do not copy the entire structure of the content - namely, please do not copy the 'Learned to love...' section in the "Languages" section.

Remember that it's what makes your resume unique that gets you noticed - please do me the service of letting me keep mine unique.

See [resume.html.haml][] for relevant source.
See [Jamie Wong's resume][] for an example.

For another resume solution, see [David Hu'sYAML-based resume system][YAML Resume]
